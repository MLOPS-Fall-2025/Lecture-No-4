# Lecture No. 4  
## Tutorial: Docker & Docker Compose  

---

## ðŸ“Œ Introduction  
So far, we deployed the Flask app directly to Azure.  

In real-world projects, developers often use **Docker** to package applications into containers.  
Containers ensure your app **runs the same way everywhere** â€“ on your laptop, a teammateâ€™s machine, or the cloud.  

**Docker Compose** helps manage multi-container applications (e.g., Flask + MongoDB + Redis).

## ðŸš€ Example Scenario  
You have a Flask app that connects to MongoDB.  

- Without Docker â†’ install Python, Flask, MongoDB, dependencies manually.  
- With Docker â†’ everything is defined in `Dockerfile` & `docker-compose.yml`.  
- Anyone can run your app with a single command:  

```bash
docker-compose up
